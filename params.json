Some applications put active tab names in their titles too (like browsers, eclipse, ...) so you can even query Untiming for information about the tabs (e.g. How many hours did I spend in GMail today?).\r\n\r\nNote: Untiming automatically detects when you are not using your system (idle time) with the help of **xprintidle**.\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n------------\r\n1. python-wnck\r\n1. xprintidle\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n------------\r\nJust run it with python:\r\n\r\n    python untiming.py\r\n    \r\nTo get a report run:\r\n\r\n    python untiming.py report <list of keywords>\r\n    \r\nFor example this will give you the usage reports for the gmail tab in your browser, eclipse and firefox:\r\n\r\n    python untiming.py report firefox eclipse gmail\r\n    \r\nTo generate this month's chart run (an HTML chart will be generated with the name of **untiming_report.html**):\r\n\r\n    python untiming.py graph <list of keywords>\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
